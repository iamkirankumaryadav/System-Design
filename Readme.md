# **System Design**

## **Machine Learning System Design** 
- Machine Learning (ML) system design involves the process of creating and deploying ML models to solve real-world problems. 
- It requires careful planning, consideration of various factors, and expertise in ML algorithms, data engineering, and software development.

### **Key Components of an ML System**

A typical ML system consists of the following components:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preparation:**
   - **Data Collection:** Gathering relevant data from various sources.
   - **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - **Data Transformation:** Converting data into a suitable format for ML algorithms.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

2. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - **Algorithm Choice:** Selecting appropriate ML algorithms based on the problem type and data characteristics.
   - **Model Training:** Feeding the prepared data into the chosen algorithm to learn patterns and relationships.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters to achieve the best performance.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - **Performance Metrics:** Assessing model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.
   - **Cross-Validation:** Evaluating model performance on unseen data to prevent overfitting.
   - **Bias and Fairness:** Ensuring the model is unbiased and fair in its predictions.

4. **Deployment:**
   - **Integration:** Integrating the trained model into the target application or system.
   - **Monitoring:** Continuously tracking model performance and identifying issues.
   - **Retraining:** Updating the model with new data to maintain accuracy over time.
